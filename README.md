Heyy here is my project on nutrition meals and plans.
This also includes users that can create a profile to view the meal plans which include healthy meals with low calories for the big backs like myself. 
Inside of this project you can see that the following code models were used including react, JSON, Mongodb and the fabulous API key. 
Here are the references I used to help create this project below: https://apilayer.com/marketplace/order_complete/spoonacular/free-plan/648?txn=free ,https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/health-tracker-using-mern-stack/
